## About

This is a workout tracker, generator and timer powered by AI

## Motivation

- To learn more about OpenAI
- To solve a problem for my fitness trainer and I - designed with our specific workout use cases in mind as we could not find a comparative solution on the market. Once completed, likely will release more generalized and be used by both fitness trainers and clients
- To code. I always need an excuse to code and this was really fun.

## About

This is a workout tracker, generator and timer powered by AI

## Motivation

- To learn more about OpenAI
- To solve a problem for my fitness trainer and I - designed with our specific workout use cases in mind. Nothing else was able to solve this. Once completed, likely will release more generalized and be used by both fitness trainers and clients
- To code. I always need an excuse to code and this was really fun.
